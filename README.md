# Machine-Learning-and-AI-Education-Curriculum-Design
Data science, analytics, AI, and big data are becoming widely used in many fields, which leads to the ever-increasing demand of data analysts, data scientists and other data professionals. Due to that, data science education is now a hot topic for educators and entrepreneurs.
In this project, we designed the curriculum for a new “Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence” program at the University of Toronto with focus not only on technical skills but also on business and soft skills. The curriculum contains optimal courses (and internships, projects, extra-curricular activities, etc.) for students to obtain necessary technical and business skills to pursue a successful career as data scientist, data manager, data analyst, business analyst, AI system designer, and etc. The curriculum design was based on the latest industrial trend and skill requirements from emloyers' perspectives that we identified through analyzing Kaggel survey data, web-scraping job postings and web-scraping online course syllabus. Lastly, we developed our own analytics-based solution in machine learning and AI education, a recommender system built with collaborative filtering. It can help users identify the gaps between their current skillset and their dream job's requirements and recommende online courses for the users in order to fill in that gap.
